Sports Team Performance Prediction

This project analyzes ODI (One Day International) cricket match outcomes to identify how toss decisions, batting order, and ground locations affect team performance. It uses real-world match data to uncover winning patterns and supports strategic decision-making through visual insights.

Objectives:

* Analyze the impact of winning the toss at The Oval.
* Study how batting first or second influences match results at Birmingham.
* Clean, merge, and explore match data for reliable insights.
* Visualize findings using pie charts for clarity.

Technologies Used:

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

Files:

* WC\_players.csv – Player data (reference)
* ODI\_Match\_Results.csv – Toss and match outcomes
* ODI\_Match\_Totals.csv – Batting totals and innings info

How to Run:

1. Load the CSV files.
2. Run the Python script to analyze and visualize match outcomes.
3. Explore visual outputs for insights into toss and batting impact.

Future Scope:

* Add machine learning models to predict match outcomes.
